# RF Engineering Portfolio – Jeff Dennis

Welcome to my RF engineering portfolio. This repository highlights a collection of technical work, design samples, automation tools, and signal processing scripts developed throughout my career as an RF and hardware engineer. My experience spans IC validation, test automation, RF circuit design, and lab infrastructure across companies such as Tarana Wireless, Renesas Electronics, Quantenna/ON Semiconductor, and General Dynamics.

## 🔧 Lab Automation & Test Scripts

Automation code written in Python and other tools to streamline RFIC validation and data analysis:
- **Python test automation** for RF parameters like OIP3, IIP3, NF, EVM, IQ mismatch
- **Excel pivot templates** for analyzing test results
- Tools for validating PMICs and trimming routines
- Includes code snippets that communicate with lab instruments
